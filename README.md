# lifespan
README for lifespan data.
In this projecct we use the lifespan data
(fMRI data of a word memory task over a 
wide range of ages) for community detection

(beginning with wavelet coherence and a
greedy louvain-like algorithm, along with
community consensus and a sweep of spatial
and temporal resolution paramters)

community detection and wavelet coherence
computation to be performed on bic cluster
